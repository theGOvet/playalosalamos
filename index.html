    <p>After nearly 20 years in England, I've returned to my roots in Spain, and now I'm offering you the chance to learn #Spanish in a relaxed, informal setting. Whether you prefer a pint or a coffee, come join me for a conversation in #Torremolinos on the #CostaDelSol. PM me if you're interested or want more details.</p>

    <p>You pick the topic, I'll pick the bar. Let's make language learning fun!</p>
